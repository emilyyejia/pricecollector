# 🧾 Price Collector

**Price Collector** is a web application designed to enhance financial literacy by allowing users to explore and compare the prices of common goods—such as food and clothing—across different countries and currencies. The app presents both local and CAD (Canadian Dollar) equivalents, making it easier to understand real-world purchasing power and currency values.

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to educate users—especially students and young learners—about:

- The impact of currency exchange rates
- Global price differences
- Economic indicators like the **Big Mac Index** and **Nike Air Force 1 Index**
- Real-world examples of inflation and price volatility

This app serves as an engaging tool to build **numeracy and economic awareness** through familiar products.

## 🔍 Features

- Browse items (e.g., Big Mac, Nike shoes) and their local prices
- See CAD-converted prices side-by-side
- Add new items with price and currency info
- Simple, responsive UI for use in classrooms or on mobile

## 🔌 Future Integration

We plan to integrate a reliable **price index API** that supports:

- Real-time and historical currency exchange rates
- Item price data over time (e.g., Big Mac prices over years)
- Support for multiple currencies

**Example APIs to consider:**
- [ExchangeRate.host](https://exchangerate.host)
- [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/)
- [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)
- [Numbeo API (Cost of Living Data)](https://www.numbeo.com/api/)

## 💡 Educational Use

The app is developed as a hands-on resource to support **ESL learners and young students** in understanding currency, value, and budgeting concepts. By comparing familiar global brands, students can connect math and economics to their everyday lives.
